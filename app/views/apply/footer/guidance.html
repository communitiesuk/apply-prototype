    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Completing and submitting your application</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">The application form is split into sections based on how it will be assessed.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You do not have to complete it in order or all at once.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Saving progress and making changes</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Your answers will not save as you type, so make sure you select ‘Save and continue’ to save any content you’ve added to a text box.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you want to save an answer you’ve given in text box but aren’t ready to answer other questions on the page, you can simply enter some placeholder text in the other boxes and select ‘Save and continue’. You can come back and add or edit answers later.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Some people like to type their answers in Word first and then copy and paste them into the text boxes.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you need to edit any sections, you can do this at any time even after you’ve marked a section as ‘Complete’.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Submitting your application</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Once you’ve marked all sections as ‘Complete’ you’ll be given the option to submit your application.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Make sure you’re happy with all your responses before submitting as you won’t be able to edit or change anything after you’ve submitted your application.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Uploading a document</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">You may need to upload a document as part of your application form. Your document should be no larger than 30MB and be in an accepted file format (jpg, jpeg, png, pdf, txt, doc, docx, odt, csv, xls, xlsx, ods).</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you need to reduce the file size, you can read guidance on this depending on your file format.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting a copy of your answers</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Once you’ve submitted your application, we will email you a link to a page where you can download a copy of your answers. This will exclude any uploaded files but will still show the names of any uploaded files.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The email will come from ‘Access funding’ and will be sent as soon as you’ve submitted your application. If you cannot find the email for any reason, do not forget to check your junk or spam folder.</p>
